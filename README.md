[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/buritica/ember-stripe-service.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/buritica/ember-stripe-service)

## Description
`ember-stripe-service` is an easy way to add Stripe.js library to your ember-cli project without having to deal with manually setting the script tag

## Features
- sets stripe.js script in index.html (test, app)
- initializes stripe with publishable key
- injects service in controllers which provides promisified method for `Stripe.createToken`
- provides debugging logs for easy troubleshooting

## Installation

* `npm install --save ember-stripe-service`
* `ember server`
* set `stripe.publishablekey` in `config/environment.js`
* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200, you should now see the stripe.js script has been included
* `Stripe` global is now available in your app

## Configuration

### Stripe Publishable Key
In order to use Stripe you must set your [publishable key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys) in `config/environment.js`.

````javascript
ENV.stripe = {
  publishableKey: 'pk_thisIsATestKey'
};
````

## Creating Stripe Tokens

`ember-stripe-service` provides a promisified version of `Stripe.createToken` which makes it easier to interact with its returns within your Ember controllers.

The method makes createToken operate under Ember run's loop making it easier to create integration tests that operate with Stripe's test mode.

To use it inside of a controller action or method you would:

````javascript

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  myCreditCardProcessingMethod: function() {

    var customer = this.get('customer');

    // obtain access to the injected service
    var stripeService = this.get('stripeService');

    // if for example you had the cc set in your controller
    var card = this.get('creditCard');

    return stripeService.createToken(card).then(function(response) {
      // you get access to your newly created token here
      customer.set('stripeToken', response.id);
      return customer.save();
    })
    .then(function() {
      // do more stuff here
    })
    .catch(response) {
      // if there was an error retrieving the token you could get it here

      if (response.error.type === 'card_error') {
        // show the error in the form or something
      }
    }
  }
})
````

## Debbuging
By setting `LOG_STRIPE_SERVICE` to true in your application configuration you can enable some debugging messages from the service

````javascript
var ENV = {
  // some vars...
  LOG_STRIPE_SERVICE: true,
  // more config ...
}
````

## Running Tests

* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

## Testing apps
Stripe functionality can be enabled / disabled via a feature flag; this is great for
integrations tests so that your integration tests do not actually hit Stripe servers.

````javascript
var ENV = {
  // some vars...
  ENABLE_STRIPE: true,
  // more config ...
}
````

When ENABLE_STRIPE is set to `false` then the Stripe service is a stub; the 
`createToken()` function will not send a request to Stripe; it will return a
canned success response.  When the stripe stub service is active, you can also
manipulate it to return an error response like so:

````javascript
var stripe = this.get('stripeService');s
stripe.setResponse(stripe.errorResponse);

````

## Upcoming Features
- I'm thinking of giving access other methods of Stripe, but I'm not sure so if you find one useful please make an issue
- PRs welcome and encouraged, and if you're not sure how to implement something we could try to work together
